      <p><strong>Curbside Thai</strong> brings the rich flavor of Thailand to
      North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35
      years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers
      that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte
      with our modern mobile food truck.
    </p>
    <p>This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy
    paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various
    mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from
    11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and
    11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the
    difference! If you can't get away from your desk,
    <em>  Curbside Thai will deliver.</em>
